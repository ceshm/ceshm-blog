It's been a long time since I wrote my first post. I also have been struggling to work on my projects, but a lot has happened in the last months. First of all, the current pandemic that is forcing most of us to stay home, which even for a hermit like me has had a negative impact on my mental health (those daily walks and trips to the caf√© were an integral part of my routine). And also, I recently started a new full-time job as a front-end developer. So all of this has kept me distracted and unable to do any progress.

### Motivation and mindfulness
As a curious person I can't help to ask my self why whenever I'm starting something new. Why am I doing this? Why now? Why this type of thing? etc. So when this happens I better start finding some compelling answers because if I don't, I quickly start losing interest in the matter. But also there is another variable to the equation which is my mental balance or simply put mindfulness. I've found that not even the most compelling reasons would make me work on a project if my mental state is unbalanced.

### Getting some delicious juice
Not a single app, game module, song or blog post has been made these last months and I have zero regrets. But this can't continue, I need to keep creating even just for the sake of it. I'm starting to feel the urges again and as I learn to adapt my daily routine to the quarantine, I'll be able to balance my creative juice levels. So what is the plan? Start exercising again, find safe ways to get outdoors, do things that I really enjoy like gardening and cooking, and eating healthy and natural (boy have I been eating really bad lately).
