Several weeks into quarantine and it's easy to see how many aspects of our life have changed for good. 
This pandemic has left a deep mark on all of us. Our interactions with others have been forced to go *online*, 
we've learned how capable we are to get work done remotely, and also how much we still need to improve and build. 
It's clearer than ever how important this *virtual* mediums are and the pain points we still need to overcome.

Many of us are found with a lot of time in our hands, time that would've been spent in activities that are now 
impossible to do, but this brings an opportunity. This is a great time for introspection. Going out (safely) and 
seeing empty streets, unprecedented low traffic, and shops closed, leaves me with a lot to think. 
One cannot help but remember those dystopian films, and also to think of the fragility of this world, 
our world we have constructed.

The 2010's gave birth to the *vaporwave* art movement. Having the world as it is today, this global and internet-native 
movement becomes even more relevant. These are the three ways that I like to think of vaporwave: as a criticism of 
capitalism, a focus on the virtual, and an exploration beyond consciousness.


## A critique of capitalism
This is probably the most famous way of seeing it. I think what's most interesting about it is that while on 
one hand capitalism gets mocked in a *reductio ad absurdum* kind of way, on the other, it seems to be glorified or 
at least payed homage by using materials produced by it (like those mall and elevator songs). 
All of which bring a fuzzy feeling of nostalgia, perhaps for the glory days promised which never came to be. 
A world of convenience and joy.

Take also this text included in the bandcamp page for the album **Ｂｕｙ Ｍｉｌｋ** by the artist **音 LIGHT システム**:

> In these modern times our trials are not those of the flesh, but of the soul. In the long treks between safe 
and understandable concepts lie a murky uncertainty. Plastic bottles of milk are stacked on shelves in such a 
way as to make the surplus appear infinite. Like the bottles of milk, our days seem without end, only to suddenly 
dwindle down to nothing - but the idea that there is no end is still very real in our minds. Shelves stacked with 
hopes and dreams. Moments crystallized into colourful, morphing cubes that seem to detach and attach themselves to 
eachother with unknown sentience. Like savouring a glass of milk, could one not also savour time?
Imagine you could buy another day...

This touches the subject of *modern trials of the soul*. Most of us that come to this scene are teens to young 
adults composing music and visual art who have had to live in a world of some failed capitalist illusions and 
consumerism-led identity. Not a great combination. So let's face it, we don't really know who we are. 
All of the sudden this turns into a search of one's identity. And the pandemic has a way of highlighting this. 
Empty malls, closed shops, empty corporate offices, shortage of certain products, below zero oil prices. Who are we?


## A focus on the virtual

Since the inception of vaporwave, the concept of virtual has been a huge source of inspiration for the movement. 
The seminal album *FARSIDEVIRTUAL*, was described by the author as a musical still life of the 21st century.

The usage of sounds coming mostly from retro devices such as PCs running old versions of windows, 
nintendo game statations, tv commercials, and others help to paint an image of an early stage *far side virtual* world. 
Most of us not even realize how far side into the virtual we are and the current events only help to get us further. 
So what is real anymore? We already have virtual elements such as those social apps embedded in our reality, 
and now that 3d sensors are being added to smartphones to "enhance AR experiences" it can only get more intertwined. 
Remote work tools, zoom meetings, texting, sexting, we now depend on this virtual world more than ever, 
it is the only way we have to keep in touch with others. How changed will the world be after this pandemic? 
how much far-side-virtual will we be after this?

## An exploration beyond consciousness
While browsing through various reddit threads with discussions of what a pice of art (specially music) has to have 
in order to be labeled vaporwave, I found many different points of view. The conclusion I came with is that vaporwave 
is a lot more than a criticism to capitalism and also more than a statement of how virtual plays a big role in our life. 
There's something else that almost all of these creations share. I've found that most of the vaporwave albums feel like 
a sonic exploration of memories, feelings, images, echoes of the past, sensations... all of these reverberating and 
creating a cloudy and immersive experience. An experience that feels like dreams, and sometimes even nightmares.

Take for example *birth of a new day*, an instrumental album that doesn't use any of the sounds associated to capitalism 
or consumerism, nor uses sounds of the current virtual world. It in exchange creates an atmosphere by using lots of 
reverb with different layers of slow sounds, all coming and going. Sonically, this is an ambient album, but one that 
also happens to be labeled vaporwave. It wants to create it's own reality, a separate one from ours. The only way I 
can find to describe it is as a *dreaming reality*, one that mirrors ours but in an ethereal way, just like dreams are. 
And just like dreams help us recover from our waking ours, this type of music invites us to take a step back from our 
current state of being, allowing us to handle better negative emotions like stress. You get into a trance where 
memories and sensations mix, feeling like an observer of your own self.

And is not only this album, many others I've found that have their own way of projecting dream vibes. 
In a more nightmarish way, the artist [骷 (Skeleton)](http://soundcpu.bandcamp.com/) manages to create a mixed experience that is meditative 
and hideous at times. [Dream Catalogue](https://dreamcatalogue.com/) is probably the most important label of the vaporwave scene, it has influenced 
a lot of music producers and has served as a filter for us fans to enjoy some quality albums. And how suiting 
of a name Dream Catalogue is.

## COVID-19
We are going through a historical event, this pandemic is causing an economic crisis that some predict to get even 
worst than the great depression of the 1930s (let's hope that's not the case). Many things at once are changing. 
And I think that the world we are living now and in the coming years will be more akin to the vaporwave movement. 
Vaporwave isn't dead, it is thriving and I'm really excited to see where it gets.
