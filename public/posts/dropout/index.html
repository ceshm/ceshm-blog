  <p>I started waking up everyday feeling miserable, most of the classes seemed pointless and I felt like I just didn&rsquo;t belong to that place. This is how I spent my last two years attending college. It was really hard to realize what I had to do, but now I feel like dropping out was one of the best decisions I could have made.</p>
<p>In 2012 I started studying the B.S. of Software Engineering, a degree that is relatively new but has started to be offered by some universities around Mexico in the last decade. And this is one of many specialized degrees that seem to continue to be added to the offerings of major Universities. My country seems to be molding workers that fit in specific ways in the puzzle that is the domestic economy. Anyhow, the academic world is so out of touch with what happens in the business world that besides the particularities of where I&rsquo;ve grown, I found out early on that the world they pictured was not the one I wanted to develop my career on. And this became even more obvious once I got an internship at a local startup. The one on which I got my first job and actually a proposal to be a late founder. Spoiler alert: things didn&rsquo;t work out in the end, as most things do.</p>
<p>The only thing that was keeping me from quitting was my mother, as I knew how important it was for her that I became an <em>ingeniero</em>. In a sense, it is a way for parents to know that they have given the best to their children, and that the actual diploma is the final proof of their success as parents. This still bugs me when I think of it. Sorry for the let down, mom.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s been over two years since I quit collage, and is fair to say that so far it has been a bumpy journey. Following my dreams and trying to forge my own path has been confusing and full of pressures both economically and socially, but also has been rewarding and freeing at times. I must ad that at this point, I have yet to generate at least one steady source of income. I have done a couple of consulting projects, but that&rsquo;s it. I&rsquo;m living on small savings and with some help of my parents in exchange of me managing their airbnb listings.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying many different things like writing (this blog for instance), learning data science, learning Japanese, doing gardening, and some other random projects/apps that hopefully will see the light of the day very soon. I really want to invest in me, in my persona, my skills, have an audience, build a platform. I realize that to achieve all of these, having the ability to stay calm despite external factors like my financial situation is gonna be key. I already started making my bets, I&rsquo;m willing to plan for the long run. And what a long run this is going to be.</p>
