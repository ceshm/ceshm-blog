  <p>It&rsquo;s been a long time since I wrote my first post. I also have been struggling to work on my projects, but a lot has happened in the last months. First of all, the current pandemic that is forcing most of us to stay home, which even for a hermit like me has had a negative impact on my mental health (those daily walks and trips to the caf√© were an integral part of my routine). And also, I recently started a new full-time job as a front-end developer. So all of this has kept me distracted and unable to do any progress.</p>
<h3 id="motivation-and-mindfulness">Motivation and mindfulness</h3>
<p>As a curious person I can&rsquo;t help to ask my self why whenever I&rsquo;m starting something new. Why am I doing this? Why now? Why this type of thing? etc. So when this happens I better start finding some compelling answers because if I don&rsquo;t, I quickly start losing interest in the matter. But also there is another variable to the equation which is my mental balance or simply put mindfulness. I&rsquo;ve found that not even the most compelling reasons would make me work on a project if my mental state is unbalanced.</p>
<h3 id="getting-some-delicious-juice">Getting some delicious juice</h3>
<p>Not a single app, game module, song or blog post has been made these last months and I have zero regrets. But this can&rsquo;t continue, I need to keep creating even just for the sake of it. I&rsquo;m starting to feel the urges again and as I learn to adapt my daily routine to the quarantine, I&rsquo;ll be able to balance my creative juice levels. So what is the plan? Start exercising again, find safe ways to get outdoors, do things that I really enjoy like gardening and cooking, and eating healthy and natural (boy have I been eating really bad lately).</p>
