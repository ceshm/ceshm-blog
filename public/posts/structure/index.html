  <p>This might be a misleading title as this is not about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_from_motion">computer vision term</a>, but a nice way of reminding myself that going for a walk, changing scenery, talking to different people, and having new experiences are crucial for having a healthy life.</p>
<p>We all have bad days were we feel really uninspired. Sometimes it really surprises me how bad it can get. Getting <strong>stuck</strong> is the best way to call it. I feel like during those times I&rsquo;ll keep dragging my emotions, small things make me really sad or angry, and getting things done seem like an impossible feat. The light that comes from dreams and goals in life just can&rsquo;t reach me.</p>
<p>So <strong>structure</strong> is the goal; having a structured mind and ordered life. This is crucial for having a clear understanding of where you are standing, having the confidence to let yourself be in the moment, stop worrying about past or future. By structured mind and ordered life I don&rsquo;t mean having a perfect thought process or following a rigorous schedule and routine. What I mean is keeping your mind in good shape so that thoughts and emotions are able to flow, and also having a life that is balanced and follows accordingly to who you are and want for yourself.</p>
<p>To get things going, we need <strong>motion</strong> which can come from small actions like going for a walk. When stuck the first spark may be to get up, put your walking shoes and head out. From that point on is just a matter of keeping the motion going, see new locations you&rsquo;ve never visited, small talk with a neighbor, stop by a coffee shop. All the sudden things start to fall into place, thoughts start flowing, emotions can finally come and go, you&rsquo;re no longer stuck.</p>
<p>Now, this may seem a bit obvious; if you are stuck, then to get unstuck you just have to break away by transforming some energy into kinetic energy. But this isn&rsquo;t so obvious, not at least to me during those times. So hopefully next time I get stuck I can quickly remind myself of what I need to do.</p>
